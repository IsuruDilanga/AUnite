# AUnite Web Application
SDGP Project AUnite

Developmental disabilities are generally considered to be a group of disorders that are caused by 
differences in the brain. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one such disorder. Those with Autism 
Spectrum Disorder may act, interact, communicate, and learn differently than most others. In 
our society, there are many autistic children who study very well, and they have lots of skills and 
abilities which can be improved. Some prefer listening to music as entertainment or parents and 
special needs instructors can also use music to help calm an ASD child. It has become such an 
integral part of our everyday lives that technology has become a necessity and has also been 
utilized by those with special needs in a more meaningful way. Children with autism learn better 
through visual and interactive methods, whether they are taught in a traditional classroom or 
through a digital platform. Hence, there is a need to improve our educational system to support 
ASD children. So, this web application named “AUnite” focuses on providing learning platforms 
to improve their knowledge.
