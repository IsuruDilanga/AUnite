                AUnite (Autism Unite) was founded by a group of passionate individuals who believe that every child, regardless of their abilities, deserves access to quality education. We know that children with Autism have unique skills and talents, and we wanted to create a platform that would allow them to showcase those skills in a supportive and inclusive environment Additionally, AUnite features an entertaining section where children can play games, listen to music, and engage in other fun activities that promote relaxation and happiness.
